## Memory
Horacio Villela Hernandez A01712206

I decided to make changes to the memory game after my team created the repository on GitHub. I uploaded my game and made modifications to it. The changes I made to the code were to create a counter for each click made in the game and to display a message when the game ends in the terminal. Most of the commits I made will be found in my Memory branch.

A small disadvantage was the use of Flake8. I tried to correct the errors marked; however, it didn't work, so I decided to leave it with as few errors as possible. It is executable but does not pass the Flake8 test.
## Tictactoe

I uploaded my corresponding game and created a new branch where I saved the changes of my commits.
The tictactoe program will run the game with the functions of the original code provided. To this code I added the following new specifications:
1. Change the size and color of the "X" and "O" symbols and center them.
2. Validate if a box is already occupied.

The colors changed were black for the background, green for the grid, and yellow and blue for the figures.
Additionally, I modified the code with the help of flake8 to adapt it to the PEP8 standard.
