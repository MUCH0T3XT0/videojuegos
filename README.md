Repository to make project evidence
## Memory
Horacio Villela Hernandez A01712206

I decided to make changes to the memory game after my team created the repository on GitHub. I uploaded my game and made modifications to it. The changes I made to the code were to create a counter for each click made in the game and to display a message when the game ends in the terminal. Most of the commits I made will be found in my Memory branch.

A small disadvantage was the use of Flake8. I tried to correct the errors marked; however, it didn't work, so I decided to leave it with as few errors as possible. It is executable but does not pass the Flake8 test.
## Tictactoe
Jaime Trujillo Ruiz A01276139 user MUCH0T3XT0

I uploaded my corresponding game and created a new branch where I saved the changes of my commits.
The tictactoe program will run the game with the functions of the original code provided. To this code I added the following new specifications:
1. Change the size and color of the "X" and "O" symbols and center them.
2. Validate if a box is already occupied.

The colors changed were black for the background, green for the grid, and yellow and blue for the figures.
Additionally, I modified the code with the help of flake8 to adapt it to the PEP8 standard.
Finally, I merge the Tictactoe branch with the main repository branch

# Pacman
Emiliano Gomez Gonzalez A01710711 user Emiidk01

This repository contains an implementation of the classic arcade game Pacman in Python using the Turtle module. 

### Creation of the "Pacman" Branch

The first step was to create a specific branch called "Packman" where I would work on the game development.

### First Commit: Uploading the Original Game

The first commit was made with the goal of uploading the original game from the freegames module to the repository.

### Checking Code with PEP8

I used the flake8 tool to check if the code followed the PEP8 standard. After some suggestions, I made the necessary changes to comply with the standard and made another commit.

### Comments and Documentation

To improve code readability and comprehension, I spent time reviewing it and adding comments following the PEP8 standard again. Subsequently, I made another commit with these changes.

### Modifications to the Game

1. **Change in the Pacman Board:**
   I modified the board layout by changing the values of 1s and 0s in the `tiles` array, which altered the game's maze. I made a commit for these changes.

2. **Increase in Ghosts' Speed:**
   To make the game more exciting, I increased the speed of the ghosts. This was achieved by modifying the parameters of the `ontimer` function, which controls the time interval of Pacman and the ghosts' movements. I made the necessary adjustments and committed these changes.

### Merging the "Pacman" Branch with the "main" Branch

Finally, after completing all modifications and improvements in the "Packman" branch, I merged this branch with the main branch of the repository.
