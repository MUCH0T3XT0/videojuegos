## Memory
Horacio Villela Hernandez A01712206

I decided to make changes to the memory game after my team created the repository on GitHub. I uploaded my game and made modifications to it. The changes I made to the code were to create a counter for each click made in the game and to display a message when the game ends in the terminal. Most of the commits I made will be found in my Memory branch.

A small disadvantage was the use of Flake8. I tried to correct the errors marked; however, it didn't work, so I decided to leave it with as few errors as possible. It is executable but does not pass the Flake8 test.
